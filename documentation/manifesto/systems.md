### New System

## The Lottery System

> "One of the biggest problems with the lottery was “the implicit message that
> we send” to low-income parents: that schools in their own communities are
> “inadequate,” and that they should seek to escape them."

> The lottery system is thought to be a major reason wealthy parents here opt
> out of public schools, further worsening segregation."

> "There are several reasons the system has not worked as intended. One is a
> lack of transportation. Fewer than 4,000 of the district’s 54,000 students
> ride a bus to school. The city’s busing program was reduced in 2010, during
> the last recession, and has not been restored"

> "The district had previously used busing to try to desegregate schools, under
> a 1983 agreement with the N.A.A.C.P. But a group of Chinese-American families
> sued in the 1990s, saying their children were being denied seats at elite
> campuses. The city settled the case by devising a
> [choice-based enrollment process](http://www.sfusd.edu/en/assets/sfusd-staff/enroll/files/SFUSD-Presentation-Handouts-1-2016-09-21.pdf)
> meant to be race-neutral but still achieve integration."

> "Affluent parents are able to take advantage of the system in ways low-income
> parents cannot, or they opt out of public schools altogether. What happened in
> San Francisco suggests that without remedies like wide-scale busing, or school
> zones drawn deliberately to integrate, school desegregation will remain out of
> reach."

> "After families submit their kindergarten applications, ranking as many school
> choices as they like across the city, a computer algorithm makes assignments.
> Those from neighborhoods where students have scored low on state tests get
> first dibs at their top-ranked programs. Each child gets an address-based
> priority at one school, but it is considered only after those with test-score
> priority are offered seats."

## Expert Knowledge System

> "I often think that the world needs to be a lot more organized. Lots of people
> write reviews of television shows, but nobody seems to collect and organize
> them all. Good introductory guides to subjects are essential for learning, yet
> I only stumble upon them by chance. The cumulative knowledge of science is one
> of our most valuable cultural products, yet it can only be found scattered
> across thousands of short articles in hundreds of different journals."
