# Guiding Focus

**Money** doesn't solve problems. It **creates problems** for people employed to solve; **solutions consumed then discarded**, uninherited by future generations; a pattern that manufactured the conjunctive word [**rediscovery**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw2Geag36NI).

Recognize we are bottled up in a one-way avenue to par monetary successes yet in no way making the global human impact that we so desire.

**A system too intricate** for an adolescent to understand, **is a system** **incapable of continuous improvement.**

**Contributions of many** outweigh the efforts of any individual or organization

**Contributions derive** not from charitable donation but **from shared** **optimism**, **shared pursuit of insight** by virtue of cultivated curiosity, **shared passion to solve problems** in interdisciplinary discussion, and above all, **shared responsibility as global people to drive human** **advancement** **forward for future generations to come.**

Solutions should be consciously **framed** in **short-**, **mid-**, and **long-term** implementation.
