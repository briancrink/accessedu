# Transition

## Making the Change

> "Social change does come down to a changing values but it's important to
> recognize that our values are not necessarily an option of free will.

> We must structurally recognize that without a change of incentives in our
> social system, our/everyone’s values will still be vulnerable to destructive,
> unsustainable, dominance, competitive and status patterns.

> In other words, human society cannot change itself from the inside as a whole.

> Now, some of us probably like yourself, can realize the way you wish to be
> without as much interference.

> We are the anomalies.

> And it still takes a great deal of education and personal reflection to reach
> a point where you reject the values of the mainstream culture that surrounds
> you, along with the procedural dynamics that are creating this prevalent
> distorted social psychology as well.

> That stated, I stand by the sociological science that says we have to change
> the prevailing social/economic structure more than anything else." Peter
> Joseph (Reddit)

> "It may be a difficult transition, but our education system cannot go on with
> business as usual. ... The learning culture on YouTube is just the opposite.

> Here we find people passionate to pass their understanding along, filling in a
> thousand little corners of knowledge.

> I think we are in the early beginnings of a historical period in which the
> Internet rewrites most of the rules and experiences of human society.

> I find it thrilling to be living in such an amazing moment." Ralph Dratman

## Restoring Values

> "One of the interesting things about work on restorative environments is to
> think about the question of restored from what?"

> "Our problems are man-made — therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can
> be as big as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings.
> Man's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable — and we
> believe they can do it again."
> [John F. Kennedy, American University, 1963](https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/american-university-19630610)
