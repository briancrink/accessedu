> "Most problems have already been solved. We're simply poor at communicating

## Diversity

## Collaboration

> "Wikipedia’s real innovation was the idea of radical collaboration. Instead of
> having a small group of people work together, it invited the entire world to
> take part. Software has been written by communities, but typically someone is
> in charge."[Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedias)

> "Conversation is the only tool for collaborating in a truly open-ended
> way."[Sam Harris # 9 1:14](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/making-sense-with-sam-harris/id733163012?i=1000342226623)

> "Be curious. Read widely. Try new things. I think a lot of what people call
> intelligence just boils down to curiosity."

> "What I hope we appreciate more because of him, is to value **diversity** and
> individual creativity in our science base." Dr. Dawes said. "We need people
> who we allow to be **driven by their curiosity**, and we also need people who
> will take those basic science ideas and turn them into useful technology."
> [Alan Turing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/science/alan-turing-desalination.html)

> “Flexner and Dijkgraaf argue that basic **research—driven by curiosity**,
> freedom and imagination is a proven and essential seed for the revolutionary
> technologies that fuel the economy, transform society, and provide solutions
> for the world’s problems. A thoughtful appeal for long-term thinking in a time
> full of short-term distractions.”
> [Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Alphabet Inc. Review on The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge by Abraham Flexner](https://library.ias.edu/files/UsefulnessHarpers.pdf)

> "Institutions of learning should be devoted to the cultivation of curiosity
> and the less they are deflected by considerations of immediacy of application,
> the more likely they are to contribute not only to human welfare but to the
> equally important satisfaction of intellectual interest which may indeed be
> said to have become the ruling passion of intellectual life in modern times."
> [The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge by Abraham Flexner p. 545](https://library.ias.edu/files/UsefulnessHarpers.pdf)

## Question

> "There's no such thing as a stupid question, but there are questions that make

> "The unexamined life is not worth living."
> [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unexamined_life_is_not_worth_living)

> "One thing I said he could be sure of, namely, that they had done their work
> without thought of use and that throughout the whole history of science most
> of the really great discoveries which had ultimately proved to be beneficial
> to mankind had been made by men and women who were driven not by the desire to
> be useful but merely the desire to satisfy their curiosity.

> "Curiosity?" asked Mr. Eastman. "Yes," I replied, "curiosity, which mayor may
> not eventuate in something useful, is probably the outstanding characteristic
> of modern thinking.

> It is not new. It goes back to Galileo, Bacon, and to Sir Isaac Newton, and it
> must be absolutely unhampered."

## Edit

> "With the time people waste reading a news every day, they could have read an
> entire book about most subjects covered and thereby learned about it with far
> more detail and far more impact than the daily doses they get dribbled out by
> the news." [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews)

> “Often I hear people say they do not have time to read. That’s absolute
> nonsense. In the one year during which I kept that kind of record, I read
> twenty-five books while waiting for people. In offices, applying for jobs,
> waiting to see a dentist, waiting in a restaurant for friends, many such
> places. I read on buses, trains, and planes. If one really wants to learn, one
> has to decide what is important. Spending an evening on the town? Attending a
> ball game? Or learning something that can be with you your life long?”
> [Education of a Wandering Mind by Louis L'Amour](https://www.amazon.com/Education-Wandering-Man-Louis-LAmour/dp/0553286528/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Education+of+a+Wandering+Man&qid=1563484617&s=gateway&sr=8-1)

> "Aaron believed that you literally ought to be asking yourself all of the
> time: **What is the most important thing I could be working on in the world
> right** **now?** And if you're not working on that, **why aren't you?**"

## Apply

> "The world that we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done

## Reason

> "We need an education system that cultivates the capacity to tolerate an idea
> that you don't like, to think about that idea, and respond to that idea..
> requiring training [doesn't come naturally and when this occurs, we will > > >

> "The ability to construct a mental model of a house comprising of bedroomed
> disciplines in one's own mind that oppose and seemingly contradict one
> another's idiosyncratic truths and values, work around to manipulate and
> wrestle with the relational views of the house as a wholistic omnipresent
> living thing from the objective, is something we must all learn to do in our
> daily studies and understandings. The ability to camp and entrench ourselves
> in deep abstract thought in one bedroom of thought and then decamp out into
> another, is how we gain the intellect of reason."
> [Sam Harris Faith in Reason #41 10:59](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/making-sense-with-sam-harris/id733163012?i=1000373557238)
