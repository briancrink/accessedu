## The Deep Thinker: One of Many 'No Child Left Behind' Edge Cases

I comment on education reform as an edge-case that propagates in numerous variants of the current paradigm that in total, collectively defines the failing state of Education.

A system tightly bound to common core curricula, aging inneffective policies, competitive game theory tactics, general intelligence theory, grades and standardized tests, and the business model of the 1880's.

Early in my adolescence, I noticed an apparent void and neglect of curiosity and passion in schools - something I had grown up with living in a family of engineers.

Both of which I see as undoubtably central for problem solvers and the greater continuation of human progress.

Leaving formal education during university, I diverged in my studies toward a playful philosophy of acquring massive tabs of pinned readings.

Contrary to regurgitation learning deployed in my school years, I was afforded the luxury of boundless time insighted for deeper levels of cognitive thinking embodied in rich, complex thoughts.

Soon there after, my unmeasured self-learning evolved into a natural appreciation and unabounded love to read, ask questions, and try everything.

I was enthused to finally learn with no objective or syllabus.

Podcasts, audiobooks, research journals, textbooks, medium articles, YouTube videos, I consumed it all.

The more sessions of deep thinking, the more those beautiful 'woooah' moments occurred.

Continuing my growth as a programmer, I needed a new set of thinking strategies derived in formal logic necessary for more effective problem-solving.

Through self-directed learning, I learned to derive insight from empirical research, formal logic, mental models, abstraction, reasoning with contradictory schools of thought, personal experience, and intuition.

All the while, I could not help but notice common problems I felt hindering my education in formal education remained unnoticed by my former peers.

There existed a strange dichotomy in the admiration I had for learning that was contrary to my former peers.

To them, learning meant homework and studying.

To me, learning meant quest and untold journey.

## Interesting Problem

I thought over education reform throughout my time in university â€” how to divert generations of curious learners away from the diploma delusion.

Having left, I simply could not shake the inner thoughts that someone is going to disrupt the American Education System in the next few years for better or for worse.

I knew too much about the unfortunate dichotomy in learning, where the education system diverged, and how to truly solve the education problem. No duct tape necessary.

## Insights Learned From Unschooling

1. Curiosity is lost when learning is constrained to a beginning, middle, and
   end.

2. Curiosity can be found.

3. Aha! moments necessitate deep uninterrupted thinking for thinking around a
   problem.

4. Deep thinking necessitates boundless time in solitude.

5. The correlative relevance of general intelligence has been found to be
   inclusive, therefore deploying the paradigm of common core, standardized
   testing, grading on the curve, gamifying learning, and artifical competition
   is unhealthy and deters learning.

6. The learn-to-work paradigm assumes students graduate with a degree as a
   market standard for employers to measure an acceptable level of competency so
   hiring qualified candidates becomes optimally predictable.

7. The piece of paper tells nothing of one's learning ability, only the graduate
   is competent enough to work as an employee of a corporation.

8. Unschooling is currently the only universal method to become truly educated.

9. Unschooling is learning for the sake of curiosity and a desire for insight.

10. Unschooling is not home schooling; merely opposite to regulating education
    in efforts to acquire a true education.

11. Unschooling opens up opportunies in ways unseen in the learn-to-work
    education paradigm.

12. Learning insights wisdom that opportunity is seen and created, not earned or
    by luck.

13. Thus, the most successful entrepreneurs historically dropped out of the
    learning-to-work paradigm due to seeing opportunity others had not.
