# Learning Model

## Ideal

provide an evolving learning framework that cultivates curiosity through natural learning, 1-1 teaching, self-directed ‘discovery’ curriculum, social role forecasting, multi-cultural relationship building / study abroad experiences

## Function

## Studies

ecological sciences \(behavioral science, economics -&gt; elimination of scarcity, resource management, improvement of human condition\)

## Feature

## Approach

autonomy becomes a reward for mastery \(Drive by Dan Pink\)

## Style

1-to-1 learning

learn-at-your-own-pace

asynchronous learning

observational inferencing

free form learning

Self-Directed Learning

Audodidactic Learning

Adaptive Learning

Imitative Learning

Discovery-based Learning

[Relationship](https://youtu.be/UCFg9bcW7Bk?t=50)

## Method

Thinking Fast and Slow

Bloom's Taxonomy \(Abstraction, Knowledge Compression\)

Paired Programming

## Promoting Values

Creativity

Communication

Collaboration

Thinking

Choice

try everything

Social recreation

Relational bonding

Initiate initiatives, projects, grass roots efforts, off-the-wall ideas

Open-Minded

willingness and desire to learn \(innate curiosity\)

Healthy behavioral cultivations

## Known Dilemma

Specialize or Broad Understanding

## Scope

## Assumption

kids don’t learn to think for themselves. [Educating an Original Thinker](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/02/educating-an-original-thinker/462468/)

Give kids all the freedom in the world, and they can get caught in choice paralysis, lack frameworks for figuring out how to approach a problem, or develop plenty of novel ideas but fail to implement them. I think balance comes in alternating different pedagogical approaches. [Educating an Original Thinker](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/02/educating-an-original-thinker/462468/)

There exists a need for a new learning paradigm to which the scope of such endeavor is beyond the capabilities of brute-force effort by any one person or group.

Culturally, we have lost faith in our children's ability to learn on their own by providing a system too structured and too focused on how the child should learn

## Known Dependency

free access to information source

## Ambiguity

Do uniforms contribute to any factors?

How do we maximize the utility of tools and technology without the negative issues?

do metrics actually work during adolescence?

at which level of understanding should learners be able to design their own curriculum?

## Known Issue

## Known Paradox

## Known Implimentation

Online University

YouTube

Online Certificates

Online Courses

Social Platforms \(communication tool, content delivery, platform\)

Content Platforms

Integrated Development Envirnments \(web service, desktop\)

## Known Contradiction

## Known Factor

Abstract concepts

## Known Insight

Learn it and do it before you learn something else

curious-driven curricula creates individual syllabi

learning can happen anywhere, everywhere, and with anyone

## Factor to Address

undo the practice of grade level, funneling into university

undo the practice of metric-based testing standard of learning \(homework, tests, grades etc\)

plagiarism

individualism \(detachment / geographical determinism\)

duplicative solutions

hyper competition

hyper memorization

## Quality Attribute

## Functional Requirement

## Non-Functional Requirement

## Challenge

## Tool

Internet Connected Devices

Whiteboard

Unbiased Search Engine

Internet 4.0 \(decentralized\)

Virtual Reality

Live Streaming

Tablet

Smartphone

Laptop

## Methodology

## Solution

## Expected Result

multi-disciplinary understanding

ability to self-organize

ability to practice essentialism

ability to seek and retrieve information

kids can take ownership over their own system of values that guided them

ability to use mental models, abstractions

the latest cutting edge innovations are learned and provided as tools for kids to use

sense of purpose

lifelong learners

sense of direction

new-found passions

cultivated playful curiosity

## Actual Result

## New Insight

## New Factor

## New Factor to Address

## New Scope
