## Discoveries

## Findings

### The 21st Century Institution

> "According to Chomsky, schools, college and universities in today's
> educational institutions are similar to factories. Students are indoctrinated
> by "liberal elites" or "intellectuals" to increase their obedience and
> conformity.; The "liberal elites" or "intellectuals are the ones who write
> history" used in schools and "we should be cautious about the alleged "lessons
> of history" in this regard; it would be surprising to discover that the
> version of history presented is self-serving and indeed it is" (Arnove,
> 2005)."
> [New Foundations by Noam Chomsky](http://www.newfoundations.com/GALLERY/Chomsky.html)

> "Chomsky defines the opposing concept of education as indoctrination, under
> which he subsumes vocational training, perhaps the most benign form. Under
> this model, “People have the idea that, from childhood, young people have to
> be placed into a framework where they’re going to follow orders. This is often
> quite explicit.” (One of the entries in the Oxford English Dictionary defines
> education as "the training of an animal," a sense perhaps not too distinct
> from what Chomsky means). For Chomsky, this model of education imposes “a debt
> which traps students, young people, into a life of conformity. That’s the
> exact opposite of what traditionally comes out of the Enlightenment.” In the
> contest between these two definitions—Athens vs. Sparta, one might say—is the
> question that plagues educational reformers at the primary and secondary
> levels: “Do you train for passing tests or do you train for creative inquiry?”

> "If people take an institution for granted, they are less likely to ask
> questions about it, to think why it is needed, to consider carefully the work
> it enables and constrains but also to think of alternatives (Jepperson,
> 1991:152). Why would you think of doing something differently or changing your

## Insights

### The World Has Changed, So Should We

> "This is a conversation that we have to have and it's a different generation,
> it's a different world view, and it's a different intellectual ante that has
> to be put up to talk about these difficult topics. It requires humility,
> willingness to learn, to camp / decamp, and to change one's mind and revise."

### Systems: When Size Increases, Value Decreases

> "The trend is clear: more power, more people, more problems. It’s not just a
> series of mistakes, it’s the tendency of the system."
> [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whorunswikipedia)

> "But formality shall go no farther. The Institute must remain small; and it
> will hold fast to the conviction that The Institute Group desires leisure,
> security, freedom from organization and routine, and, finally, informal
> contacts."
> [The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge by Abraham Flexner p. 552](https://library.ias.edu/files/UsefulnessHarpers.pdf)

### Discovery is Collective, Not Attributable

> "One must be wary in attributing scientific discovery wholly to any one
> person. Almost every discovery has a long and precarious history. Someone
> finds a bit here, another a bit there. A third step succeeds later and thus
> onward till a genius pieces the bits together and makes the decisive
> contribution. Science, like the Mississippi, begins in a tiny rivulet in the
> distant forest. Gradually other streams swell its volume. And the roaring
> river that bursts the dikes is formed from countless sources."
> [The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge by Abraham Flexner p. 549](https://library.ias.edu/files/UsefulnessHarpers.pdf)

### Inquiry is Iterative, Not Linear

> "Both were made by thoroughly scientific men, who realized that much "useless"
> knowledge had been piled up by men unconcerned with its practical bearings,
> but that the time was now ripe to raise practical questions in a scientific
> manner."
> [The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge by Abraham Flexner p. 549](https://library.ias.edu/files/UsefulnessHarpers.pdf)

### Roles Matter, Not Titles

> "Wikipedia’s biggest problems have come when it’s strayed from this path, when
> it’s given some people official titles and specified tasks. Whenever that
> happens, real work slows down and squabbling speeds up. But it’s an easy
> mistake to make, so it gets made again and again."
> [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whorunswikipedia)

> "A stipend was awarded to enable a Harvard professor to come to Princeton: he

## Contradictions

### The Gamification of Learning

#### Failing

> "People hate failing, so much so that they’re afraid to try."
> [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitwrong)

> "Which is a problem, because failing is most of what we do, most of the time.
> The only way to stretch your abilities is to try to do things a little bit
> beyond them, which means you’re going to fail some of the time."
> [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitwrong)

> "Try and fix the people so that they don’t feel embarrassed at failing or try
> to fix the environment so that people don’t fail. It seems quite likely that a
> lot of the fear is induced by a goal-oriented educational system, obsessed
> with grades for work (A, B, C) and grades for students (1st, 2nd, 3rd). And
> perhaps the fear of being wrong you see in older people stems from having been
> through such experiences in childhood. If this is the case, then simply
> building a decent non-coercive environment for children will solve the
> problem." [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitwrong)

> "Find some way to detach a student’s actions from their worth. I failed
> therefore I am a failure. I succeed therefore I am successful."
> [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitwrong)

> "How do we build educational institutions that discourage these ways of
> thinking. Obviously we’ll want to get rid of competition as well as grades,
> but even so, as we saw with Mission Hill, kids are scared of failure."
> [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitwrong)

#### Making The Grade

> "If you have a classroom of kids and you give them a bunch of tasks they can
> work on of varying difficulty, the kids will pick the tasks that are just
> outside their level, that stretch them to do a little bit more. (This is, of
> course, if they aren’t getting graded on this. If they’re getting graded,
> they’ll always pick the easy ones.)"
> [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitright)

> "Curricula's promote copy-paste learning. Google the assignment, copy the work
> done by a previous student, and paste the solutions."
> [Scott Hebert](https://youtu.be/mOssYTimQwM?t=433)

> You learn it, memorize it, test on it, forget it.
> [The Learning Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve)

> "Our educational systems are really a result of this same structure which is
> why kids learn to memorize things rather than critical thought, while being
> organized in grade hierarchies, while also subservient to authority. They are
> being groomed for "jobs." Peter Joseph on Reddit

#### Deadline Learning

> "Removing deadlines and requirements should help students live more fully in
> the moment. Providing basic care to every student should help them feel valued
> as people. Creating a safe and trusting environment should free them from
> having to keep track of how much they can trust everyone else."
> [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitwrong)

#### Competition in the Classroom

> "Even weirder are the competitive situations. If I’m playing a game that
> relies solely on practice against someone who’s practiced more than me, I’m
> probably going to lose, no matter how good a person I am. Yet I still feel
> degraded when I do."
> [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitwrong)

> "When nobody knows you’re getting it wrong, it’s a lot easier to handle it.
> Maybe because you know it can’t affect the way people see you."
> [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitwrong)

### Question Everything (with an asterisk)

> "Still, in the universities or in any other institution, you can often find
> some dissidents hanging around in the woodwork—and they can survive in one
> fashion or another, particularly if they get community support.

> But if they become too disruptive or too obstreperous—or you know, too
> effective—they’re likely to be kicked out.

> The standard thing, though, is that they won’t make it within the institutions
> in the first place, particularly if they were that way when they were
> young—they’ll simply be weeded out somewhere along the line.

> So in most cases, the people who make it through the institutions and are able
> to remain in them have already internalized the right kinds of beliefs: it’s
> not a problem for them to be obedient, they already are obedient, that’s how
> they got there.

> And that’s pretty much how the ideological control system perpetuates itself
> in the schools—that’s the basic story of how it operates, I think."

> [Understanding Power by Noam Chomsky, p. 248](http://www.ditext.com/chomsky/power.pdf)

### Status Quo Bias: A Culture of Institutionalized Conformity

> “Going to college was not a prerequisite to the practice of the learned
> professions. Learning often took place outside the academy in various forms of
> apprenticeship.”
> [A History of American Higher Education by John Thelin](https://books.google.com/books?id=pmqBDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT68&ots=pK93saCIH0&pg=PT68#v=onepage&q&f=false)

> "Currently, Chomsky's considers educational institutions today to be where
> "human beings have no intrinsic, moral and intellectual nature, that they are
> simply objects to be shaped and private managers and ideologues-who, of course
> perceive what is good and right" (Arnove, 2005); Instead, educational
> institutions should be interested in "what the student discovers for
> themselves when their natural curiosity and creative impulse are aroused not
> only will be remembered but will be the basis for further exploration and
> inquiry and perhaps significant intellectual contribution" (Arnove, 2005)."
> [New Foundations by Noam Chomsky](http://www.newfoundations.com/GALLERY/Chomsky.html)

> “The idea of education has been so tied to schools, universities, and
> professors that many assume there is no other way, but education is available
> to anyone within reach of a library.”
> [Education of a Wandering Mind by Louis L'Amour](https://www.amazon.com/Education-Wandering-Man-Louis-LAmour/dp/0553286528/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Education+of+a+Wandering+Man&qid=1563484617&s=gateway&sr=8-1)

**Annotation:** Louis says education was tied to schools despite having access
to public libraries. Despite now having the Internet, education is a
multiplier-effect times more coupled to the schooling system than what it was in
a half-century ago. How is that possible? Can that be sustainable?

### Setting Students up For Failure

- Free Information

### Value Flow

- tuition
- campus buildings
- on-campus housing
- food plans
- hidden misc. fees
- parking
- technology
- salary

### College: Land of Opportunity For Profiteers

- College = business park full of corporate office buildings and administrators
- sold to students
- necessary for a career in nearly every field
- professors have become adjunct
- privatized institutions
- unregulated by proxy of shady lobbying business practices
- A degree is an **investment** in students' financial success backed by
  **banks, government, corporations, capital investors, and families.**
- Inflated tuition. how? university tuition are littered with mandatory living
  fees (mandatory parking, meal plans, expensive housing, hidden misc)

### Mediocracy through Mass Appeal

> "Colleges need to drop the focus-group-enforced blandness. As Malcolm Gladwell

> [Why We Need an Open Curriculum](https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2014/07/21/why-we-need-an-open-curriculum/)

### Meaningless Work

> "Over a period of one or two hundred years the contributions of professional
> schools to their respective activities will probably be found to lie, not so
> much in the training of men who may tomorrow become practical engineers or
> practical lawyers or practical doctors, but rather in the fact that even in

> Out of this useless activity there come discoveries which may well prove of
> infinitely more importance to the human mind and to the human spirit than the
> accomplishment of the useful ends for which the schools were founded."

> [The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge by Abraham Flexner p. 549](https://library.ias.edu/files/UsefulnessHarpers.pdf)
