## Teaching

### Just-In-Time

> "The trick to education is to teach in such a way that people only find out they're learning when it's too late." [Harold Edgerton](https://youtu.be/u9hauSrihYQ?t=778)

### Lecturing

> "But while this may be an extreme version of it, at its essence, this is the college lecture. Someone who \(we’ll give them the benefit of the doubt\) is quite smart appearing stupid for fifty minutes so that they can communicate basic facts to kids “at their level”. Edward Tufte teaches us to always ask about the information density of a method of communication. The information communicated in this lecture could have fit on one side of a single piece of paper"[Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/awfullectures)

## Learning

### Self-Directed Learning

> "Introduce more individualism into American schools, it seems clear that one solution is to have people do work on their own." [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitwrong)
