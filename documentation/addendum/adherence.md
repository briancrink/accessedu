## The Deep Thinker: One of Many 'No Child Left Behind' Edge Cases

I comment on behalf of an edge-case of American Education, one that propagates
in numerous variants that collectively defines the failing state of the
Education System.

My experiences depict the failures among edge-cases in a system tightly bound to
common core curricula, aging inneffective policies, competitive game theory
tactics, general intelligence theory - test scores and grades, and the business
model of the 1880's-1900's to produce meaningless work.

The deliberate neglect and void of curiosity and passion is a common
characteristic of the edge-cases amassed throughout our Education System -
curiosity, undoubtably a characteristic central for the continuation of progress
in our systems of today and tomorrow.

The disregard I have for the competitive nature of the education system
compounded into a non-conformist set of ideals.

A divergent and unmeasured “learn what I want to learn when I want to”
philosophy evolved into a natural appreciation and love to read, ask questions,
and try everything.

Self-learning led to a thorough examination of my cognitive learning techniques
for effective problem-solving.

Contrary to regurgitation learning, I learned to refine my cognitive learning
techniques to derive insight from empirical research, formal logic, mental
models, abstraction, reasoning with contradictory schools of thought, personal
experience, and intuition.

## Interesting Problem

I have thought over the education reform throughout my time in university — how
to divert generations of curious learners away from the diploma delusion derived
from the business leaders of the late 1880's.

I simply can't shake the inner thoughts that someone is going to disrupt the
American Education System in the next few years for better or for worse.

## Opportunity

Open AccessEdu is an initiative to bring those same opportunities to the land of
opportunity and greater world of learners.
