# Open Learning Space

## Ideal

Learning spaces purposed solely for learning and the application of learned
knowledge, skills.

Learning spaces similar to workspaces currently available to professionals in
cities.

Performing arts and athletic endeavors will be diverted from localized
institutions to global academies specifically for adolescent development in
performing arts and athletics.

Reconstruct traditional brick & mortar schools and infrastructure into open
green learning spaces to promote ad-hoc learning, environmentally friendly
spaces, and a human reconnection with the natural world

School should be a place where kids learn to love learning, not where they get
stifled by drill sergeants

instead of centralizing every career speciality like dancing, theatre, sports,
music, etc... why don't we let the academies develop those skillsets and let the
learning spaces focus solely on learning (history, math, sciences, tech,
language)

learning space is firmly planted into the Earth as an endless scape into the
natural ethos of the region

## Function

Implement future-proof learning spaces as alternatives to classic brick & mortar
schools.

Decentralize learning from localized institutions to freely-open learning
spaces.

## Feature

treehouses

ad-hoc seating

## Scope

## Assumption

The learning methods in learning spaces is not limited to social, active,
individual learning.

## Ambiguity

how would this model be any different from summer camp?

how would this model by any different from private boarding school?

how would this model maintain cultural integrity in every region (like inner
cities)

how would this model address adverse weather climates?

how would this model address adolescent metrics? should we cyborg our kids or no
metrics until

should the space adapt to the environment or should the space be designed to fit
every environment?

what approach would be taken to financially afford academies if academies are
decentralized from learning spaces? If Johnny wanted to play ice hockey and
learn Jui Jitsu, how could he reasonably afford to do both without the piling up
of expenses? (some practical conflicts in the decentralization of academics
involve scheduling, financial cost, adaptability of switching focuses)

## Known Issue

## Influence

City Center (Indianapolis)

YMCA

Community Centers

Learning Centers (Huntington)

Playgrounds

## Known Factor

## Known Insight

architecture inspires and provides sense of community

### Adolescent Behaviors

kids love to run

kids love to climb

kids love to be outside

kids love to get messy

kids love both constructive and destructive behavior

## Known Dependency

allocate appropriate resources to construct specific environment types

wifi

natural materials

self-sustaining green energy (zero emissions)

## Ensure

learners do not feel isolated like in a jail playground

teacher can float from one kid to the next

every material should provide a certain feeling

spaces for stem, media content creation, preservation of environment sciences,
global relations

## Factor to Address

undo the disregard of ethics and green living

## Quality Attribute

innovating cutting-edge

easily maintainable / cleanable

adaptable spaces

feel of a park

## Functional Requirement

seasonally adaptive

cultivates space for quiet minds, constructive behavior

cultivates space for running, chaos, destructive behavior

provide spatial opportunies for learning

use natural materials to build the scape (boulders for seating, etc)

## Non-Functional Requirement

## Challenge

## Tool

## Methodology

## Solution

## Expected Result

## Actual Result

## New Insight

## New Factor
