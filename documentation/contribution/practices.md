# Best Practices

Since **adaptation is constant**, **deadlining solutions** to match the pace of
technological innovation and socioeconomic reform **is unreasonable**.

**Deadlining ignores** the primary dependency of all solutions, **the rate of**
**human brain power.**

**Solutions removed of deadlines** preserve open contribution without
unrealistic expectations to push scheduled dependencies on any individual.

Framing the learning model in an **agile, always-deployable state** sustains the
quality of **adaptability**.

The **integrity of any given learning model** should be continuously tested for
the **durability and accuracy** of all system qualities.

**Critique the process**. Recognize that building anything worthwhile takes
time, **slower conversations**, and **slowing internally**.

Tools are just that. Power comes from appropriate utilization of tools and
**conscious application** of attributes on a system at a given time.
