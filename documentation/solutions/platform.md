# Open AccessEdu; A Platform for Problems

## Ideal

Voice infrastructure problems in the effort to evolve and raise living standards

contributors develop **in-house dependencies and assets** free from operational overhead costs throughout the supply chain down to the granular resources and energy

## Function

## Feature

## Promote

decision transparency

## Scope

## Ambiguity

Does there exist any assets, dependencies owned, maintained through financial purchasing means by AccessEdu?

**assets:** domain, github account, social accounts \(twitter, instagram, youtube, vimeo\), workflow tools \(slack, trello, email\)

**third-party dependency:** domain lease, electricity for Internet and web hosting, computer hardware \(data storage, processing\), software \(open source platform, communication platform, social media platform, tools and project management\), content \(images, visualization, video, audio, app, software, information\)

**running costs:** data storage, domain leasing \($/annual\), electricity for Internet and web hosting

## Methodology

## Solution

a tool could be developed to facilitate the methodology for open-sourcing \(non-software\) projects.

* github has a page containing \[open, closed, archived\] issues with associating

  tags that acts as the front-end for potential user-stories.

* Recall how kanban boards orient backlogs full of cards containing

  issues/problems/bugs/feature\_requests tagged with the `issue #` from the

  frontend. Each card implies a tailing set of tasks to be done to `resolve` the

  issue or deploy a `solution`

* this scenerio applies to \#\# software operations **and therefore** all modern

  **business operation**

* therefore, why shouldn't this methodology also apply to Socioeconomic models?
* think of the Company or Community as the Fn\( \);
* where open source community-based projects act as `software companies` for the

  public people acting as the `end user`. Each open-source project acting as a

  function.

* where \[issue, problem, solution\] are variable pairs; issue = parameter,

  problem = argument, solution = ouput

* Solution = OpenAccessEdu\(issue\);
* Feature = Company\(user\_story\);
* Product = Company\(request\);
* Solution = Company\(issue\);
* `$ Company(user_story); -> feature_v1.0.0`
* \[Problem \#23, Solution \#23\]
* \[Issue \#24, Solution \#24\]
* Issue \#25 \[Request, Feature\]
* Issue \#23\[Problem, Solution\]

## Issue Tracking

> "One way to do that would be to have some sort of complaint-tracking system for articles, like the discussion system of talk pages. Instead of simply complaining about an article in public, Stallman could follow a link from it to file a complaint. The complaint would be tracked and stored with the article. More dedicated Wikipedians would go through the list of complaints, trying to address them and letting the submitter know when they were done. Things like POV allegations could be handled in a similar way: a notice saying neutrality was disputed could appear on the top of the page until the complaint was properly closed."
