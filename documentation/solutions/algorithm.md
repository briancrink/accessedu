# Field Team Role Placement Algorithm

## Ideal

Remove human-intervention in the hiring process

> "What will eventually get built is a system that understands them as

> anything." Laszlo Bock (Former Head of Human Resources at Google)

## Add reference

> "Any method that emphasizes competency and skills over things like ethnicity
> is a welcome development and truly part of the Swedish innovation

Leaner's forge their own curriculum (no one chooses a student's curriculum)

## Function

Implement a hiring solution to reduce prospecting latency

Optimally match candidates with employers based on higher-quality metrics.

Develop a streamlined method / tool that autonomously and dynamically matches
employers with workers (Removes the use of the Resume)

## Feature

## Scope

## Assumption

There exists a direct relationship wherein the more diverse the data is, the
more targeted the matchmaking process will be.

There exists human bias pertaining to (gender, ethnicity, voice, education,
appearance, mutual-interest, emotional (empathetic) bias rising from informal
conversations before or after an interview

There exists an unsustainable and undesirable level of resources (time) wasted
in the process of matching. ex (date scene, parking spaces, hiring, seeking
apartments, seeking roommates)

There exists an inherent bias in every human deployed in the interview process
correlating specific desirable / undesirable traits based on personal
interactions (stereotyping).

There exists a set of human traits, behaviors, skillset, and preferences that
must be taken into consideration and given proper weights to satisfy a mutually
optimal match between candidate and employer.

There exists an error in human perception and logical thinking by the employer
during the interview process, beyond the capability of any given mathematical
solution.

There exists a direct relationship wherein salary-based work promotes
competition that evokes conflicting ambitions and systemic inequality in the
pursuit of equal or higher pay.

There exists inconsistency in the success rate of any given new-hire and company
to mutually satisfy one another's need. (any given new-hire does not meet
productivity expectations or a new company does not fulfill a positive workplace
culture.)

There exists inconsistency in the metrics being quantified and measured in
candidates, depending on the company, industry, culture, location.

There exists a disproportional valuation of a candidate's likability factor over
competency in any given company resulting in advantageous opportunity for the
well-liked candidates.

There exists an unsustainable level of inflated
_[bullshit jobs](https://medium.com/philonomist/david-graeber-on-capitalisms-best-kept-secret-704f13914a88)_
in global economies.

There exists an unsatisfactory level of uncertainty in commitment to any given
match. (candidate may accept an opportunity from Company A but
[_ghost_](https://www.businessinsider.com/workers-ghosting-jobs-quitting-2018-12)
Company A for a greater opportunity offered by Company B.)

There exists human bias in the interview process within the first 20 seconds of
human interaction, among other conscious and subconscious biases seen throughout
the interview process.

There exists a lack of standardized social awareness in opportunity acceptance.
ex (candidate commits to Company A but Company B still assumes candidate is
available.)

## Known Issue

> "Recruiting is very much a leap of faith.

> It's a huge investment.

> It's a huge commitment.

> And you need to believe in the decision that you make.

> I find it very difficult to believe that recruiting managers will rely on a
> robot.

> [...] The candidate will come to the interview thinking: 'Is this a place
> where I want to work? 'Is this somebody I want to work with?'

> They get their own gut feeling and it will affect their decision a great deal.

> I am very concerned about what robots may do to that part of the

## Known Insight

> "Interviews are like dating; it doesn't matter how nice you are or what a

> Q: "how do you differentiate between two candidates who are equally

> A: "I don't think there's such thing as two people who are literally equally

> enough to make that much of a difference, but you can use that to help you
> make the call."

> A: "Or go with your gut. If you like them both that much, consider hiring them
> both. I'm a big fan of hiring ahead of my growth. Always look ahead at what
> your needs are going to be, not just the ones you have now. And remember, it's
> not just about skills. EQ matters." Gary Vee

## Factor to Address

### Quantifying Competency

Should Soft Skills be Quantified?

To what extent do ethics play in the event of qualifying a person's soft skills?
(**Assumption** — to the individual, inherent pressure is placed on the
individual to fit a certain mold to receive a given role)

What is the best method to retrieve the most qualitative data? ex( is the data
more accurate when self-assessed by questionnaires or when a quality of someone
is peer reviewed?)

What is the purpose in measuring human soft skills? Does qualitative data about
a human provide valued insight to how well a person is capable of a role?

Are there methods to measure data wherein the integrity of the data can stand on
it's own merits? ex( what is the best method to measure a person's degree of any
given characteristic, say "to what degree is _Person 1_ a **leader** given \*_
role_ in _Environment C_")

_Further_, if a given person is quantified as 70% of a natural leader, but
applies to a role with a strongly weighted leadership emphasis, person might
attain false hope in pursuing an opportunity said person will not be _most_
qualified for. ex (one who is 70% of a leader will never be awarded the
opportunity when there exists a candidate is >71% of a leader.)
