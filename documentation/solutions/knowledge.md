An intuitive solution would be to either refer back to a centralized knowledge-based system \(similar to wikipedia\) or adopt a record-based distributed network \(similar to blockchain\) for general public knowledge.

## Assumption

running energy costs would be reduced to nothing and the remaining costs would be relating to physical hardware, maintanence, and land property.
