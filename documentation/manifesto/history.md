# American Education: A History Lesson

## Timeline (1825-Current)

### 1825

**Assumptions**

There existed an issue with religious affiliation in education.

There existed an issue with the factor of affordability in education.

**Ideals**

> After his presidency, Jefferson tackled the issue of education.

> He wanted to move away from the religious ties to college, and also wanted it
> to be paid for by the general public so that students who were less wealthy
> could attend

> Jefferson’s hope was that anyone could freely attend, as long as they had the
> ability — a perfect meritocracy.

**Known Problems**

**Known Factors**

**New Factors**

Free public education in primary schooling, agnostic education, and the ideal of
a perfect meritocracy.

**New Insights**

**New Policies**

> Well ahead of his time, free public education (in primary schooling) didn’t
> overtake private education until the late 1800s

**New Outcomes**

### 1862

**Assumptions**

**Ideals**

> The purpose of the land-grant institutions was:

> “without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including
> military tactic, to teach such branches of learning as are related to
> agriculture and the mechanic arts in order to promote the liberal and
> practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and
> professions in life.” —Title 7, U.S. Code

**Known Problems**

**Known Factors**

> This bill was created in response to the industrial revolution and the myriad
> of “practical” professions this innovative time period was creating —
> machinists, farmers (as a vocation vs. a lifestyle), even engineers.

**New Factors**

> It was at this time that college truly transitioned from being about civic
> leadership and classical (read: philosophical) learning to being about
> vocational learning.

**New Insights**

> People were starting to realize that in a changing, industrial world, certain
> professions had specific educational needs.

**New Policies**

> The Morrill Land-Grant Act is passed into law by President Lincoln, which
> allowed states to freely receive land for public universities — so-called
> land-grant colleges.

> The Morrill Land-Grant Act is often called the singular source of practical
> and affordable higher education

**New Outcomes**

> 70 U.S. institutions were created as a result of this act (including the
> second Morrill Land-Grand Act in 1890).

### 1880-1900

**Assumptions**

**Ideals**

> More leaders of industry on their boards, who in turn asked the question, “Why
> can’t college be run like a business?”

**Known Problems**

**Known Factors**

> This period also sees the buildup of great wealth among prominent figures and
> therefore more discretionary income.

> This led to new levels of philanthropic generosity, and colleges topped the
> list of institutions to give to.

> Remember, although there weren’t a great number of college alumni, many civic
> and business leaders had attended college.

**New Factors**

**New Insights**

**New Policies**

**New Outcomes**

> They gave back to their institutions.

> They also used their connections in this golden age of illustrated magazines
> to work their PR charm and **get the physical beauty of many college** >
> **campuses out in front of the nation’s eyes.**

### 1900

**Assumptions**

**Ideals**

**Known Problems**

> Although degrees are conferred after four years of education, it’s still the
> case that the majority of students leave after just two years of school.

> In fact, at William & Mary, 90% of students between 1880-1900 ended their
> studies after two years

**Known Factors**

> After that point, they could earn their L.I. Certificate (License of
> Instruction), which would allow immediate employment in various fields.

> College admission remained low.

**New Factors**

> Architecture was a tool to attract more young men to make college alluring.

**New Insights**

**New Policies**

> College Entrance Examination Board formed (now known as just College Board).

> This organization seeks to standardize college entrance requirements in order
> to make sure the “product” of US colleges is up to par.

**New Outcomes**

> Eventually, it’s this organization that owns and operates SAT testing, CLEP
> testing, and the Advanced Placement (AP) program

### 1930

**Assumptions**

**Ideals**

**Known Problems**

**New Factors**

**New Insights**

**New Policies**

**New Outcomes**

> Tuition prices at private schools begin to rapidly escalate.

### 1920-1940

**Assumptions**

**Ideals**

**Known Problems**

**Known Factors**

**New Factors**

**New Insights**

**New Policies**

**New Outcomes**

> The average tuition nearly doubled from $70 ($600 today) to $133 ($1,100
> today)

### 1960

**Assumptions**

**Ideals**

**Known Problems**

**Known Factors**

**New Factors**

> Because public schools get the majority of government funding, they are able
> to keep tuition prices low.

**New Insights**

> Since these private schools are now setting themselves apart, they of course
> become even more prestigious to the public, and everyone wants in

**New Policies**

**New Outcomes**

> Private schools, however, are having to continue to raise tuition prices in
> order to meet inflation and also provide a “luxury” product that would
> differentiate them from public institutions.

> In order for people to afford these schools, they come up with creative
> financial aid packages to get students in classrooms.

> They utilize a mix of grants, loans, and work-study opportunities.

> They tout small class sizes, study abroad opportunities, and niche class
> topics to stand apart from state schools.

### 1972

**Assumptions**

**Ideals**

**Known Problems**

**Known Factors**

**New Factors**

**New Insights**

> Instead of the government subsidizing schools for student tuition, they’ll now
> give money directly to the students.

**New Policies**

> The Basic Educational Opportunities Grants (BEOG) program takes effect.

> These were need-based grants given to full-time students, and those students
> were required to remain in good academic standing.

> Later, these grants are renamed Pell Grants.

**New Outcomes**

> The basic structure of Pell Grants remains nearly the same today, with the
> infamous FAFSA forms determining how much is given to each student

### 1975

**Assumptions**

**Ideals**

**Known Problems**

> For the first time in 24 years, college enrollment drops from the previous
> year.

**Known Factors**

**New Factors**

**New Policies**

> Due to student anti-war protests, the rise of independent research institutes,
> and various other factors, the government pulls a large amount of funding for
> universities.

**New Insights**

> The golden age of the American university is officially over, and schools must
> re-invent themselves to again gain favorable reputation.

**New Outcomes**

> This leaves them in a bit of a crisis, as many of them had operating budgets
> that relied on this funding.

> This led to two major changes:

> First, colleges began paying more attention to what students/parents wanted in
> terms of services and curriculum offered.

> Second, colleges began to welcome and even recruit part-time, transfer, and
> older, “non-traditional” students — groups who were previously just an
> afterthought.

### 1980

**Assumptions**

**Ideals**

**Known Problems**

**Known Factors**

**New Factors**

**New Insights**

> As private universities continue their tuition hikes, and now state schools
> follow due to funding cuts, more than half of first-time college freshmen are
> enrolled at community colleges.

**New Policies**

**New Outcomes**

> And yet, Thelin writes that “the dominant image of the ‘real college
> experience’ remained indelibly linked to the four-year, full-time residential
> tradition.

### 1980's

**Assumptions**

**Ideals**

**Known Problems**

**Known Factors**

**New Factors**

**New Insights**

> The discovery of the so-called Mt. Holyoke phenomenon:

> Charging higher tuition leads to a greater number of applicants, as well as
> academically higher quality applicants.

> To the college applicant (and their parents), price equals prestige.

**New Policies**

**New Outcomes**

> This phenomenon has not abated.

### 2008

**Assumptions**

**Ideals**

**Known Factors**

> In the 80s and 90s, banks were giving mortgages at incredibly low interest
> rates to anyone that applied.

**Known Problems**

> The recession hits, in large part due to the mortgage bubble.

> There were hardly any checks in place to determine if people could actually
> pay their bills.

**New Factors**

**New Insights**

> The recession means that more and more students need more and more financial
> aid in order to attend college

**New Policies**

**New Outcomes**

> Many economists are saying that student debt could be the next economic
> bubble.

### 2010

**Assumptions**

> Thelin notes that “most colleges have succumbed to the misplaced belief that
> there is an indelible connection between academics and employment.”

**Ideals**

**Known Factors**

> Criticism begins to surface about the connection between a college degree and
> employment.

**Known Problems**

> While colleges tout the need for a degree to be employed, many graduating
> students — even in traditionally high placement fields like business and
> medicine — are not finding work.

**New Factors**

> Other factors include overstaffed administrative offices, many of whom are
> overpaid (the average VP or dean — of which there are often a dozen or more
> per school — makes well over six figures, and up to seven figures), as well as
> colleges feeling the need to cater to prospective students in the form of
> luxurious dining halls, dormitories, fitness centers, and coffee shops.

**New Problems**

> This makes it difficult to get a job after college, and students are unable to
> pay back their debt.

> Because of this, almost half of college graduates aged 20-24 are back at home,
> living with their parents.

> Colleges are increasingly running into financial problems.

**New Insights**

> Only 17 colleges have self-supporting athletic programs — that is, programs
> that are funded entirely through their own revenue.

> At most large schools, football budgets alone exceed what the athletic
> department brings in.

> Meanwhile, the unemployment rate for 20-24-year-olds hovers at around 15%.

> Student loan debt overtakes credit card debt in America for the first time.
> The average student who took out loans for school owes ~\$25,000, largely to
> the U.S. government (they bought out most student loans during the recession).

> Because of these increasing costs, tuition prices are rising at about three
> times the rate of inflation

**New Policies**

**New Outcomes**

> Big-time college athletic programs take more and more heat, especially in
> terms of how much of the general operating budget they consume.

> Part of this can certainly be blamed on the athletics funding mentioned above.

> Commercialism has found its way to the university.

## The Classical Education: 20th Century

### The Quintessential Institution

> "The Institute is, from the standpoint of organization, the simplest and least
> formal thing imaginable. It consists of three schools - a School of
> Mathematics, a School of Humanistic Studies, a School of Economics and
> Politics.

> Each school is made up of a permanent group of professors and an annually
> changing group of members. Each school manages its own affairs as it pleases;
> within each group each individual disposes of his time and energy as he
> pleases. The members enjoy precisely the same freedom as the professors.

> They may work with this or that professor, as they severally arrange; they may
> work alone, consulting from time to time anyone likely to be helpful. No
> routine is followed; no lines are drawn between professors, members, or
> visitors.

> Princeton students and professors and Institute members and professors mingle
> so freely as to be indistinguishable. Learning as such is cultivated. The
> results to the individual and to society are left to take care of themselves.
> No faculty meetings are held; no committees exist.

> Thus men with ideas enjoy conditions favorable to reflection and to
> conference. A mathematician may cultivate mathematics without distraction; so
> may a humanist in his field, an economist or a student of politics in his.

> Administration has been minimized in extent and importance. Men without ideas,
> without power of concentration on ideas, would not be at home in the
> Institute."
> [The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge by Abraham Flexner p. 551](https://library.ias.edu/files/UsefulnessHarpers.pdf)

### What It Means To Be Truly Educated

> “If I were asked what education should give, I would say it should offer
> breadth of view, ease of understanding, tolerance for others, and a background
> from which the mind can explore in any direction.

> Education should provide the tools for a widening and deepening of life, for
> increased appreciation of all one sees or experiences.

> It should equip a person to live life well, to understand what is happening
> about him.”
> [Education of a Wandering Mind by Louis L'Amour](https://www.amazon.com/Education-Wandering-Man-Louis-LAmour/dp/0553286528/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Education+of+a+Wandering+Man&qid=1563484617&s=gateway&sr=8-1)

> “A book is less important for what it says than for what it makes you think.”
> [Education of a Wandering Mind by Louis L'Amour](https://www.amazon.com/Education-Wandering-Man-Louis-LAmour/dp/0553286528/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Education+of+a+Wandering+Man&qid=1563484617&s=gateway&sr=8-1)

> "Chomsky defines his view of education in an Enlightenment sense, in which the
> “highest goal in life is to inquire and create.

> The purpose of education from that point of view is just to help people to
> learn on their own.

> It’s you the learner who is going to achieve in the course of education and
> it’s really up to you to determine how you’re going to master and use it.”

> An essential part of this kind of education is fostering the impulse to
> challenge authority, think critically, and create alternatives to well-worn
> models.

> This is the pedagogy I ended up adopting, and as a college instructor in the
> humanities, it’s one I rarely have to justify."
> [Noam Chomsky](http://www.openculture.com/2012/11/noam_chomsky_spells_out_the_purpose_of_education.html)

> views expressed by the founder of the modern higher education system, Wilhelm
> von Humboldt, leading humanist, a figure of the enlightenment who wrote
> extensively on education and human development and argued, I think, kind of
> very plausibly, that the core principle and requirement of a fulfilled human
> being is the ability to inquire and create constructively independently
> without external controls.

> Be in a position to inquire and to create on the basis of the resources
> available to you which you've come to appreciate and comprehend.

> To know where to look, to know how to formulate serious questions, to question
> a standard doctrine if that's appropriate, to find your own way, to shape the
> questions that are worth pursuing, and to develop the path to pursue them.

> That means knowing, understanding many things but also, much more important
> than what you have stored in your mind, to know where to look, how to look,
> how to question, how to challenge, how to proceed independently, to deal with
> the challenges that the world presents to you and that you develop in the
> course of your self education and inquiry and investigations, in cooperation
> and solidarity with others.

> That's what an educational system should cultivate from kindergarten to
> graduate school, and in the best cases sometimes does, and that leads to
> people who are, at least by my standards, well educated
> [Noam Chomsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYHQcXVp4F4)

> “Graduates should excel in the essential skills of oral and written
> communication, critical thinking, and quantitative analysis.

> Every student should leave with a broad knowledge of the social and natural
> world, a keen sense of self, an awareness of our membership in a global
> society, and understanding of what it means to be thoughtful and responsible
> citizens of the community, state, and nation in which they live.”
> [Why We Need an Open Curriculum](https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2014/07/21/why-we-need-an-open-curriculum/)

> “It seems to me that educated people should know something about the
> 13-billion-year prehistory of our species and the basic laws governing the
> physical and living world, including our bodies and brains.

> They should grasp the timeline of human history from the dawn of agriculture
> to the present.

> They should be exposed to the diversity of human cultures, and the major
> systems of belief and value with which they have made sense of their lives.

> They should know about the formative events in human history, including the
> blunders we can hope not to repeat.

> They should understand the principles behind democratic governance and the
> rule of law.

> They should know how to appreciate works of fiction and art as sources of
> aesthetic pleasure and as impetuses to reflect on the human condition.

> On top of this knowledge, a liberal education should make certain habits of
> rationality second nature.

> Educated people should be able to express complex ideas in clear writing and
> speech.

> They should appreciate that objective knowledge is a precious commodity, and
> know how to distinguish vetted fact from superstition, rumor, and unexamined
> conventional wisdom.

> They should know how to reason logically and statistically, avoiding the
> fallacies and biases to which the untutored human mind is vulnerable.

> They should think causally rather than magically and know what it takes to
> distinguish causation from correlation and coincidence.

> They should be acutely aware of human fallibility, most notably their own, and
> appreciate that people who disagree with them are not stupid or evil.

> Accordingly, they should appreciate the value of trying to change minds by
> persuasion rather than intimidation or demagoguery.”
> [Steven Pinker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYHQcXVp4F4)

### The Educated Man: From Blue to White Collar

> “Given that tuition, room, and board charges at many colleges were minimal,
> why did more young men and women not opt to enroll? The American economy
> provides two very different explanations.

> On the one hand, many families could not afford tuition payments, however low;
> more important, they could not afford the forgone income or forfeited field
> labor of an elder child who went from farm to campus.

> On the other hand, in those areas where the American economy showed signs of
> enterprise and growth, a college degree—even if affordable and accessible—was
> perceived as representing lost time for making one’s fortune.

> This perception held for such high-risk ventures as land development, mining,
> and business. It also pertained to the learned professions of law and
> medicine, where academic degrees were seldom if ever necessary for
> professional practice.

> The college in this era, then, was but one means of finding one’s place in
> adult society and economy.”
